# Stroke Prediction Web Application
This repository contains code for a web application designed to predict the likelihood of a person experiencing a stroke based on various demographic and health-related features. The application is built using Python and FastAPI for the backend, and Streamlit.

## Features
The web application utilizes a machine learning model trained on a dataset containing information about individuals' gender, age, hypertension, heart disease, marital status, work type, residence type, average glucose level, body mass index (BMI), and smoking status. The features used for prediction include:
